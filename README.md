[Live Preview](https://shop-salary.onrender.com/)

Salary Manager is a site designed to minimize the time required for calculating the salary of an individual. It can be used by any shops (full-scale shops) to calculate their salesperson's salary. We designed it to address issues specifically with Vishala Shopping Malls.

## About Salary Manager

#### How to use this?

Input the time an individual arrived (early or late) based on their working hours, and it will calculate the overtime (O.T). By entering their current reserved salary and the days present, the app will continue to perform these calculations for you.

#### Future improvements?

We are planning to scale this for individual employee data, including their previous salaries, overtime, and more, while integrating with a database.
